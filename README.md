# Gomoku_BoardGame
 <p>I created a Gomoku board game as part of my personal project in Java. The game can be played inside the Java terminal. The goal of this game is to connect five in any direction. Two players are required to play. The board size is 19x19 and initially covered with the number 0. Each player will input the position (X, Y) on the game board where they want to place their mark. Connecting six is not possible; only connecting five will lead to victory.</p>
